# Search and Download Resource Files with C#

in a given collection and download them to the file system. Specifically, it downloads UBS images, but
the same process can be used to cycle through any collection of resources.

# Dependencies

This requires [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or higher.

# Setup

Add your API key to the `appsettings.json` file, then run the application.
